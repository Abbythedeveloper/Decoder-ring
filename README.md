# Decoder Ring App
The Decoder Ring app allows users to encode and decode messages by using various ciphers: Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, 
or the Substitution Cipher. 
When building this application, I applied the test-driven development approach and wrote a series of unit tests with Mocha and Chai 
to test the complex algorithms.
